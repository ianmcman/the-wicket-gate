title: Welcome to the Wicket Gate
---
Hello, I am Ian and this is the Wicket Gate, a blog where I (and possibly my friends) will be talking about things that are of interest to me or us. The particular topics that I have an interest in are Particular Baptist theology and technology.

Now for some information about me. I am, as of today, I am a garbage man but I'm in school right now for a diploma in network management. I already have an associate's degree in applications development.

That's about all I have for this introduction. I can't wait to keep writing. Happy reading!
